# BY1QH_K1_Remake
CQ DE BH9DWE! Elecraft is a famous amateur radio manufacturer but its rather expensive to afford. These days I tried to read and understood the original equipment Elecraft K1's principle and managed to modify it. So I push the PCB files to my GitHub and share it to all HAMs.

Firstly I read the manual and understood the schematic diagram of K1, found some components, such as JFET J309, is not available in online shopping network. So I modified the design a little bit. Then I bought and soldered the components of receiver of K1 on the board. After a series of debugging, I managed to make the circuit receiving CW signals on amateur bands.

The receiver is succeed in receiving but there is still some problems such as amplifier noise, RF filter attenuation and so on, so I tried to draw the circuit into PCB. If the PCB version works well, I will continue adding functions and modifying design to improve its performance, such as adding frequency display, multi-band filter and band controller, transmitter, SSB module, antenna turning unit and so on.
